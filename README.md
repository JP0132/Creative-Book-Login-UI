# Creative Book Login UI

This was for the following frontend UI challenge:

_To create a sign up page, modal form or app screen related to signing up for something. It could be for a volunteer event, context registration, a giveway or anything you can image._
_You may only use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, please do not use any external libraries._

For this challenge I decided to create the UI for a book club, however, I did not want to submit a simple, static login page. Therefore, for this project I decided to create the forms within a book.

- Being restricted to only HTML, CSS and JS with no external tools, I used CSS to animate the flip effect of the book.
- JavaScript was used to handle which page is being turned over and the direction (next or previous page).
- Utilised the perspective to make the page actually seems like it is turning.
- To create a more appealing UI gave the pages a paper look by blending a paper image and colours to make it look a the pages of a book.
